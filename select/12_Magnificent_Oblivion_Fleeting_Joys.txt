I know when
I see through
I'm trying
It's all true
And here now
Inside you
Alone
I invite you
It rains down
Like fire
Your secret desire
I know when
I see through
I'm trying
It's all true
The sunrise
The sunset
We're here now
But not yet
I know you
What we get
Is something
That we let
The moment
Is gone now
We lost it
And somehow
The sunrise
The sunset
We're here now
But not yet
I know when
I see through
I'm trying
It's all true
And here now
Inside you
Alone
I invite you
The moment
Is gone now
We lost it
And somehow
The sunrise
The sunset
We're here now
But not yet
