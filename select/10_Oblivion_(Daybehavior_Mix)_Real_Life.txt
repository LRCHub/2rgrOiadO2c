Here in my heart I am running out of virtue
Whatever I do I would never want to hurt you
When it comes to this I feel fine but I have to admit
Here in my heart I am running out of virtue
Then life goes on
And the world turns round
Yeah life goes on
And the world turns round
Oblivion bring it on
Oblivion bring it on
Oblivion bring it on
Oblivion bring it on

For once in my life I can feel no satisfaction
Whatever I do I am losing your reaction
When it comes to this I feel fine but I have to admit
For once in my life I can feel no satisfaction
Then life goes on
And the world turns round
Yeah life goes on
And the world turns round
Oblivion bring it on
Oblivion bring it on
Oblivion bring it on
Oblivion bring it on
