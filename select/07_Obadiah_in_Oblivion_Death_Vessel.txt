Obadiah was a cripple and a crumb on the beak of a bald-headed bird
Gone south as would anyone
Go figure or go hard

And in the dark he whistled over an dover
Aglow with solar powered sustain

Double gated/domed myucking on gum
Ran the rink everyone rolled on
Pumpking Noney into nickelodeons with ungodly reason

And in teh dark he whistled over and over
Aglow with solar powered sustain

If halfsies are equal to none
And nothing is precious enough for us
Then we are none, perfectly none

Obadiah went on living in a lag breaking even when oneing-up
Zeroing-in on everything
No, nothing can be cheapened

If halfsies are equal to none
And nothing is precious enough for us
Then we are none, perfectly none
