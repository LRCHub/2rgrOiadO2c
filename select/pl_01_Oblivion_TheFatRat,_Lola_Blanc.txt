I, I want you to lift me up so
high, high
A place that no one's ever been
Take me to oblivion
Oh, oh, I wanna feel the dark
with you, oh
A place that no one's ever been
Take me to oblivion
A place that no one's ever been
Take me to oblivion
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
I, I want you to lift me up so
high, high
A place that no one's ever been
Take me to oblivion
Oh, oh, I wanna feel the dark
with you, oh
A place that no one's ever been
(No one's ever been)
Take me to oblivion
Oh oh,
Oh oh,
Oh oh,
Oh oh
Take me to obli-i-i-i-i-i-i-i
